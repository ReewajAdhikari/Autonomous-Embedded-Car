# 🚗 Autonomous Embedded Car (MSP430 + CCS)

This project is an **autonomous embedded car** developed using the **MSP430 microcontroller** and programmed in **C with Code Composer Studio (CCS)**.  
The car uses sensors for path-following and obstacle detection, while motor drivers handle real-time motion control.  

---

## 📌 Features
- Path-following with IR/line sensors  
- Obstacle detection using ultrasonic sensors  
- DC motor control via L298N driver  
- Embedded C firmware written in CCS  
- Modular and extendable design for new sensors or behaviors
